Friends,

Tlon is not so much a fortified ice castle as your cool uncle’s garage where he’s always got a car half taken apart and a lot of power tools that he lets you use and doesn’t tell your parents.

And yet, Urbit fans and contributors outside of the organization don’t know what we’re up to (unless they're on Talk religiously, which some are). Anyway, this is a pity, but an addressable pity. Starting two weeks ago, we’ve taken steps to right this wrong and committed to writing Weekly Updates every, um, week. Well, actually, we started doing this last November (around the time posts here became less frequent), but we're recommitting ourselves to a 'weekly' schedule.

The hope is that these short updates keep you abreast of new developments and maybe even help you dream a little with us.

You can find past, present and future updates on [Fora](https://fora.urbit.org/updates/)

See you on Talk !

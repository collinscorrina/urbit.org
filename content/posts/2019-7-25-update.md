![](https://media.urbit.org/site/posts/updates/~2019.7.25-update-1.jpg)

We released Urbit `v0.8.0` this week and breached the network. See the [release notes](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/releases/tag/v0.8.0). The Arvo sourcecode – previously in its own repository – has been merged into the [Urbit repository](https://github.com/urbit/urbit), and Urbit now builds with [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/).

Amongst many exciting improvements and overall greater network stability, `v0.8.0` comes with a [new version of Landscape](https://github.com/urbit/interface), which provides a framework for writing new apps and feels much more like using the operating system Urbit is.

**Jared** `~nidsut-tomdun` now the maintainer and release-manager of [Urbit](https://github.com/urbit/urbit), spent much of the past few weeks testing and then shepherding `v0.8.0` out the door.  

**Joe** `~master-morzod` has also been preparing `v0.8.0` for release, fixing numerous bugs, and simplifying Urbit's automagic DNS (`*.arvo.network`). He's also been looking into integrating [Jaque](https://github.com/frodwith/jaque) – a Graal/Truffle Nock interpreter intended to replace much of Vere – and an [`:acme`](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/master/pkg/arvo/app/acme.hoon) rewrite.

**Philip** `~wicdev-wisryt` has been working on replacing `%jael` with [`%kale`](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/tree/philip/kale) and `:eth-watcher` with [`azimuth-tracker`](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/1320).

**Ted** `~rovnys-ricfer` has made great progress integrating new `%ames` ["alef"](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/tree/alef-breach). It can nearly say `|hi` to itself.

**Elliot** `~littel-ponnys` has been working on an example social application that makes use of ring signatures in Arvo, called ["Safe"](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/tree/safe-prototype). 

**Ben** `~pitmug-roptec` has been [rewriting](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/tree/bs/uterm/pkg/hs-urbit/lib) Vere's "king" process – the part that interfaces with the host system – in Haskell, toward improved maintainability. He's also working on a new language, called [Conq](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/bs/conq-attila-hoon/pkg/hs-conq/lib/Language/Conq.hs).

**Mark** `~palfun-foslup` has been working on next-gen [Bridge](https://github.com/urbit/bridge/tree/mino) with **Matt** `@shrugs`, and [Peerlist](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/1309), a mechanism for peer-discovery on the network.

Until next time.

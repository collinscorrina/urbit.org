We run a security bug bounty program with [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com). See the [Tlon Corp](https://hackerone.com/tlon/) page at HackerOne for more information. 

If you've found a vulnerablity, and you'd like to claim a bounty, please submit a report there. Note that our bounty program is currently focused on [Azimuth](https://github.com/urbit/azimuth) vulnerabilities.

For general inquiries and disclosures, please contact our security team at [security@tlon.io](mailto:security@tlon.io).
